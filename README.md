- **Collections**: Organize content into themed folders
- **Likes & History**: Track everything users interact with
- **Personalized Recommendations**: AI-driven content suggestions
- **Universal Search**: Search across all content types

### ðŸŽ¨ Modern Interface
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with desktop optimization
- **Dark Theme**: Eye-friendly dark interface
- **Smooth Animations**: Polished user interactions
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Power user features

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone and navigate to the project:**
   ```bash
   cd ahoy-super-platform
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your settings
   ```

5. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```
   Or directly:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Visit the application:**
   The application will automatically find an available port between 5001-5010 and display the URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5003`)

### Port Management

The application automatically checks for available ports in the range 5001-5010 to avoid conflicts with other services (like macOS AirPlay Receiver on port 5000).

**Check available ports:**
```bash
python scripts/check_ports.py
```

### Docker Deployment

Create a `Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["gunicorn", "-w", "4", "-b", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app:app"]
```

## Development

- **SQLite**: For simple deployments
- **MongoDB**: For document-based storage

## Security Considerations

- **Password Security**: Consider upgrading to bcrypt
- **Input Validation**: Validate all API inputs
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement for production
- **CORS**: Configure for API access
- **HTTPS**: Use SSL in production

## Performance Optimizations

## Development Log

### December 19, 2024 - Major Feature Implementation: Working Likes/Bookmarks & Playlists

**Problem Identified:**
- Like and bookmark features were not working due to missing API contracts
- Frontend buttons were using local state only, not persisting to backend
- Playlist functionality was incomplete with "boards" vs "playlists" terminology confusion
- No reliable REST endpoints for user activity persistence

**Backend Changes:**

1. **Created `storage.py`** - Thread-safe JSON storage module
   - Implements file locking to prevent data corruption during concurrent writes
   - Provides `read_json()` and `write_json()` functions with atomic operations
   - Ensures data integrity across multiple user sessions

2. **Created `blueprints/activity.py`** - New activity management API
   - `GET /api/activity/me` - Retrieve user's likes, bookmarks, and play history
   - `POST /api/activity/like` - Toggle like status for tracks/shows/artists
   - `POST /api/activity/bookmark` - Toggle bookmark status for content
   - `POST /api/activity/played` - Mark content as played (updates history)
   - Uses session-based authentication with proper error handling

3. **Created `blueprints/playlists.py`** - Complete playlist CRUD API
   - `GET /api/playlists` - List all user playlists
   - `POST /api/playlists` - Create new playlist with name/description
   - `PUT /api/playlists/<id>` - Update playlist metadata
   - `DELETE /api/playlists/<id>` - Delete playlist
   - `POST /api/playlists/<id>/items` - Add content to playlist
   - `DELETE /api/playlists/<id>/items` - Remove content from playlist
   - Full CRUD operations with proper validation

4. **Updated `app.py`** - Registered new blueprints
   - Added blueprint imports and registration
   - Integrated with existing session-based authentication
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing endpoints

**Frontend Changes:**

1. **Updated `static/js/app.js`** - Enhanced with new API integration
   - Added `api()` helper function for consistent API calls
   - Implemented event delegation for like/bookmark buttons
   - Added automatic UI state updates with CSS class toggling
   - Integrated error handling with user notifications

2. **Replaced `static/js/playlist-manager.js`** - Complete rewrite
   - New modular approach with proper API calls
   - Exported functions for playlist management
   - Added form submission handling for playlist creation
   - Integrated with global notification system

3. **Updated HTML Templates** - Added data attributes for API integration
   - **`templates/music.html`**: Added `data-like`, `data-bookmark`, `data-id`, `data-kind` attributes
   - **`templates/shows.html`**: Added same data attributes for show content
   - All like/save buttons now properly wired to backend APIs

**Data Structure Changes:**

1. **New Data Files:**
   - `data/user_activity.json` - Stores user likes, bookmarks, and play history
   - `data/playlists.json` - Stores user playlists and playlist items
   - Both files use thread-safe JSON operations

2. **Removed Legacy Code:**
   - Eliminated all "boards" terminology and replaced with "playlists"
   - Removed unused board-related functions from `user_manager.py`
   - Cleaned up template references to old board system

**Key Features Now Working:**

âœ… **Likes & Bookmarks:**
- Persistent storage across page refreshes
- Works for both tracks and shows
- Immediate visual feedback with CSS classes
- Proper error handling and user notifications

âœ… **Playlist Management:**
- Create, edit, delete playlists
- Add/remove content from playlists
- Persistent storage per user
- Full CRUD operations via API

âœ… **Data Persistence:**
- Thread-safe JSON file operations
- User-specific data organization
- Atomic write operations prevent data corruption

**Testing:**
- Created `test_likes_playlists.py` for API endpoint testing
- All endpoints properly authenticated and validated
- Data files created and updated correctly

**Technical Improvements:**
- Event delegation for better performance
- Proper error handling throughout
- Consistent API response format
- Thread-safe file operations
- Clean separation of concerns

**Files Modified:**
- `storage.py` (new)
- `blueprints/activity.py` (new)
- `blueprints/playlists.py` (new)
- `blueprints/__init__.py` (new)
- `app.py` (updated)
- `static/js/app.js` (updated)
- `static/js/playlist-manager.js` (replaced)
- `templates/music.html` (updated)
- `templates/shows.html` (updated)
- `test_likes_playlists.py` (new)

**Result:** The platform now has fully functional likes, bookmarks, and playlist management that persists across sessions and provides immediate user feedback.
