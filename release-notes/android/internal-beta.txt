What’s new in this build

• Refreshed experience: Ahoy gives you music, podcasts, shows, radio, and saved items in one modern interface.

• Persistent mini player: A compact player stays at the bottom so you can control playback from anywhere. Play/pause, previous/next, boost, bookmark, and queue—with a layout tuned for phones.

• Instant playback: Tracks and podcasts start playing immediately when you tap them. Play/pause state stays in sync across the app.

• Android Auto: Use Ahoy in the car. Browse “All Music,” “Artists,” and “Podcasts” from your Android Auto screen and control playback with the in-car UI.

• Account and wallet: Sign in, see your balance, add funds, and view transaction history. Boost artists directly from the app.

• Mobile reliability: Fixed a bug that could freeze the screen after load. Scrolling is smooth; if you ever don’t see the latest update, open the in-app refresh option or visit /refresh.

• Also in this build: Focus mode timer, forgot/reset password, checkout and success flows, tip artist and wallet pages, 404 and offline handling, and cache improvements so you get the latest content.

Thanks for testing. Please send feedback via the in-app Feedback option or to your usual contact.
