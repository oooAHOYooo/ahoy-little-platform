# Resend Quick Setup - Your API Key

## ✅ Your Resend API Key

Your API key is: `re_csHQ4MFH_MKH3wsNwtCd7556Toic1NXuG`

## 🚨 Important: Domain Verification Required

**Status:** API key works ✅, but domain `ahoy.ooo` needs verification ⚠️

### Quick Fix: Verify Domain in Resend

1. **Go to Resend Dashboard:** https://resend.com/domains
2. **Click "Add Domain"**
3. **Enter:** `ahoy.ooo`
4. **Add DNS Records** (Resend shows you exactly what to add):
   - SPF record (TXT record)
   - DKIM record (TXT record)
   - DMARC record (optional but recommended)
5. **Wait for verification** (5-15 minutes)
6. **Done!** Emails will work

### Alternative: Use Resend Default Domain (For Testing)

If you want to test immediately without domain verification:

1. **Set on Render:**
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_csHQ4MFH_MKH3wsNwtCd7556Toic1NXuG
   SUPPORT_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev
   ```
2. **This works immediately** but sender will be `onboarding@resend.dev`
3. **Later:** Verify your domain and switch to `support@ahoy.ooo`

## 🔧 Setup on Render

### Step 1: Add Environment Variables

Go to **Render Dashboard** → **ahoy-little-platform** → **Environment** and add:

```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_csHQ4MFH_MKH3wsNwtCd7556Toic1NXuG
SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@ahoy.ooo
```

(Or use `onboarding@resend.dev` temporarily if domain not verified)

### Step 2: Deploy/Restart

After adding environment variables, restart your service or wait for next deploy.

### Step 3: Test

```bash
# On Render Shell
python scripts/check_email_config.py
python scripts/test_send_email_to_alex.py
```
